## Overview

To realize a digital twin in a chemical plant, it is necessary to have a physical model (first-principles model) that can accurately represent the actual process. However, physical model building requires trial and error by researchers with expertise, making it difficult and costly. We have been developing an artificial intelligence (AI) based system called AutoPMoB (automated physical model builder) that automatically constructs physical models from literature databases.


(Under construction)
<!-- Towards the realization of AutoPMoB, we are developing fundamental technologies as follows: -->
